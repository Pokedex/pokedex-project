# Ironhack Pokédex
## **Introduction**
On this respository you can find a Pokédex created with all knowledge adquired on the previous weeks of Ironhack mixing Frontend and Backend modules.</br>
## **How it works**
To see all the Pokémons and be able to capture them and complete the Pokédex (you'll have to do a lot of work...) you need to be registered and logged in.</br>
Once you are a trainer you can navigate through all the Pokédex and capture all the Pokémons that you want, easy right?</br>
Maybe you'll miss many Pokémons, but don't worry, you can go to [Add Pokémon to Pokédex](https://pokedexproject1.herokuapp.com/addspottedpokemon) where you can add and capture </br>as many as you want.</br>
Did you add a wrong Pokémon? Don't worry, go to the Pokémon page and delete it.</br>
Remember that you can only have 6 Pokémons on your team, so choose them wisely and if you want to change your team, you have to first remove one and then add the new Pokémon.</br>
## **Setup**
Enjoy visiting our first web app and remember [You Gotta Catch 'Em All!](https://pokedexproject1.herokuapp.com/)</br>
